There are two different notions of highly disconnected spaces.
\begin{definition}
    A topological space $X$ is called \emph{totally disconnected}, if any subset of $X$ containing more than one element is disconnected.
    It is called \emph{totally separated}, if any two points $x,y\in X$ can be separated by a clopen (closed and open) $U\subset X$ with $x\in U$ and $y\not\in U$.
\end{definition}
Any totally separated space is totally disconnected:
Let $A\subset X$ be a subset containing two distinct elements $x,y \in A$. Take $U$ a separating clopen set with $x\in U$, $y\not\in U$. 
The complement $U^c = X\setminus U$ of $U$ is clopen aswell.
Then $A = (A\cap U) \cup (A\cap U^c)$ is a decomposition of $A$ into two nonempty open sets, hence $A$ is disconnected.
The converse however is generally not true
\begin{example}
    Consider the space $X = \N\cup \{\infty, \infty^\prime\}$ with discrete topology on $\N$ and open sets around $\infty$ or $\infty^\prime$ containing all except finitely many natural numbers.
    The map $n\mapsto \frac{1}{n}$ identifies this space with the subspace $\{1/n \:\vert\: n\in\N\}\cup\{0,0^\prime\}$ of the \emph{line with two origins} $\R_0^+\times\{1\} \amalg \R_0^+\times\{-1\} / \sim$ where $(x,1)\sim (x,-1)$ whenever $x>0$.

    $X$ is not hausdorff, as the sequence $(n)$ converges both to $\infty$ and $\infty^\prime$.
    The clopen set $\{\infty,\infty^\prime \}\cup \{m \:\vert\: m> n\}$ separates $\infty$ or $\infty^\prime$ from $n$, so all sets containing both an element from $\N$ and one from $\{\infty,\infty^\prime\}$ are disconnected.
    Furthermore the subset $\{\infty,\infty^\prime\}$ inherits the discrete topology, as there are open sets around $\infty$ not intersecting $\{\infty^\prime\}$ in $X$.
    Thus also the subspace $\{\infty^\prime,\infty\}$ is disconnected, hence $X$ is totally disconnected.

    $X$ is however not totally separated: Any open set around $\infty$ contains infinitely many $n\in \N$, its closure then contains $\infty^\prime$ aswell. 
    Hence $\infty$ and $\infty^\prime$ may not be separated by a clopen set.
\end{example}
\begin{lemma}
    A compact hausdorff space is totally disconnected if and only if it is totally separated
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By above, totally separated always implies totally disconnected. 
For the other direction, let $X$ be totally separated and $x,y\in X$. 
Pick open neighbourhoods $x\in U$ and $y\in V$ with $U\cap V = \emptyset$ by the Hausdorff property of $X$.
    Since $X$ is totally disconnected, $U\cap V$ is disconnected and hence admits a clopen decomposition $\widetilde{U}\cup \widetilde{V}$ with $\widetilde{U} \cap \widetilde{V} = \emptyset$.
\end{proof}

We first discuss classical Stone duality between totally disconnected compact Hausdorff spaces and boolean algebras.

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{Stone space} is a totally disconnected compact Hausdorff space.
  We denote the category of Stone spaces and continuous maps by \(\Stone\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{boolean algebra} is a commutative ring \(A\) (with unit \(1\)) such that every element \(a\in A\) is \emph{idempotent}, that is, \(a^2=a\).
  We denote the category of Boolean algebras and ring homomorphisms by \(\Bool\).
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  The two element set \(\{0,1\}\) becomes a Stone space by equipping it with the discrete topology.
  Moreover, it carries the structure of a boolean algebra by identifying it with \(\F_2\), the finite field with two elements.
  (In fact, \(\F_2\) is a \emph{boolean algebra object} in the category of Stone spaces.)
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  For every Stone space \(X\), the set \(\Cont(X,\F_2)\) of continuous maps from \(X\) to \(\F_2\) becomes a boolean algebra with respect to pointwise addition and multiplication.
  Note that \(\Cont(X,\F_2)\) is in bijection to the set of clopen subsets of \(X\).
  (This is an isomorphism of boolean lattices?)
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
  \leavevmode
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      Arbitrary products of Stone spaces are Stone spaces.
    \item
      Closed subspaces of Stone spaces are Stone spaces.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By Tychonoff, arbitrary products of compact spaces are compact.
  The same holds for Hausdorff spaces and totally disconnected spaces (?).
  \dots
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
  Let \(A\) be a boolean algebra.
  The set \(\Hom(A,\F_2)\) of ring homomorphisms from \(A\) to \(\F_2\) is a closed subset of \(\prod_{a\in A}\F_2\) equipped with the product topology.
  Endowing it with the induced subspace topology, it becomes a Stone space which is called the \emph{spectrum} of \(A\) and denoted by \(\Spec(A)\).

  Missing: Show that this is homeomorphic to the Zariski spectrum!
  Under this homeomorphism, the standard open subsets \(D(a)\), where \(a\in A\), correspond to open sets of the form
  \[\{\phi\in\Spec(A) \mid \phi(a)=1\},\]
  which are henceforth denoted by \(D(a)\) as well.
  In fact, \(D(a)\) is also a closed set, since \(\Spec A\setminus D(a)=D(1-a)\).
  Consequently, the spectrum of a boolean algebra possesses a basis of clopen subsets, which gives another proof that it is totally disconnected.
\end{example}

\begin{thm}[Stone Duality I]
  Assigning to a Stone space \(X\) the boolean algebra \(\Cont(X,\F_2)\), and to a boolean algebra \(A\) its spectrum \(\Spec(A)\), constitutes an equivalence of categories
  \[
    \Stone \simeq \Bool^{\rm op}.
  \]
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  First of all, the assignments \(X\to\Cont(X,\F_2)\) and \(A\mapsto\Spec(A)=\Hom(A,\F_2)\) are obviously (contravariantly) functorial (by precomposition).
  We are then to show that they are mutually (pseudo)inverse to each other, that is, we have to find natural isomorphisms \(X\cong\Spec(\Cont(X,\F_2))\) and \(A\cong\Cont(\Spec A,\F_2)\).
  Both of these are defined as evaluation maps.

  More precisely, let us first consider the map
  \[e:X \longrightarrow \Spec(\Cont(X,\F_2)), \quad x \longmapsto (e_x:f \mapsto f(x)).\]
  Obviously \(e_x\) is a morphism of boolean algebras.
  To show that \(e\) is continuous, let \(f\in \Cont(X,\F_2)\) and \(D(f)\) the associated standard clopen set in \(\Spec(A)\).
  Its preimage under \(e\) is the set of all \(x\in X\) such that \(f(x)=e_x(f)=1\).
  This condition is equivalent to \(f(x)\neq 0\) which is an open condition, so \(e\) is continuous.
  Missing: Bijectivity, naturality.

  Next, consider the evaluation map
  \[e:A \longrightarrow  \Cont(\Spec A,\F_2),\quad a\mapsto (e_a : \phi\mapsto \phi(a))\]
  which is obviously a ring homomorphism.
  To prove injectivity, suppose that \(a\neq 0\).
  By Zorn's lemma, there is a maximal ideal \(I\) of \(A\) which contains \(1-a\neq 1\).
  Since quotient of boolean rings are boolean, and quotients of rings by maximal ideals are fields, the quotient ring \(A/I\) is (uniquely) isomorphic to \(\F_2\).
  By composing this isomorphism with the canonical projection \(A\to A/I\) we obtain a morphism of boolean algebras \(\phi:A\to \F_2\) with kernel \(I\).
  In particular, \(\phi(1-a)=0\), or equivalently, \(\phi(a)=1\), so \(e_a\neq 0\) which proves injectivity.

  For surjectivity, let \(f:\Spec A \to \F_2\) be any continuous function.
  Such a function is uniquely determined by the clopen set \(U=f^{-1}(1)\subseteq\Spec(A)\).
  If we can find an \(a\in A\) with \(U=D(a)\), then \(f\) is exactly \(e_a\).
  Since \(U\) is open, it can be written as a union of standard open sets.
  But since \(U\) is closed and thus compact, finitely many of these suffice, say, \(U=D(a_1)\cup\dots\cup D(a_n)\).
  Recall from above that in a boolean algebra, \(\Spec(A)\setminus D(a)=D(1-a)\).
  Moreover, the standard opens satisfy the property \(D(a)\cap D(b)=D(ab)\) (this holds in the spectrum of every ring).
  Therefore, if we define \(a\) as \(1-(1-a_1)\cdots (1-a_n)\), we obtain
  \[
    D(a) = \Spec(A)\setminus (D(1-a_1)\cap\dots\cap D(1-a_n)) = D(a_1)\cup\dots\cup D(a_n) = U.
  \]
  [The proof of surjectivity corresponds to Exercise 23 (iii) in Atiyah-MacDonald.]
\end{proof}
}

Consider the following three categories.

1) {\em Profinite sets} {\bf ProFin} \\
Objects: $\lim_{i\in I}S_i$ for $S_i$ finite sets, $I$ cofiltered poset
($\forall i,j \exists k\leq i,j$)
\\
Morphisms: 
$$
  \Hom(\lim_{i\in I}S_i,\lim_{j\in J}T_j) := \lim_j\colim_i\Map(S_i,T_j)
$$

2) {\em Totally disconnected compact Hausdorff spaces} {\bf DiscComp}

3) {\em Boolean algebras} {\bf Boolean} \\ 
Objects: commutative rings $A$ such that $x^2=x$ for all $x$ 

\begin{prop}[Stone Duality]
There are equivalences of categories
$$
  \textbf{ProFin} \stackrel{\sim}\longrightarrow 
  \textbf{DiscComp} \stackrel{\sim}\longrightarrow  
  \textbf{Boolean}^{\rm op}.
$$
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
For 1) $\to$ 2) $\to$ 3), equip $S=\lim S_i$ with the (inverse,
projective) limit topology and assign to it the Boolean algebra
$$
   \Cont(S,\F_2) = \colim_i\Map(S_i,\F_2).
$$
Conversely, assign to $A$ the profinite set
$$
  \Spec A = \Hom(A,\F_2) = \lim_{A_i\subset A\text{ finite}}\Hom(A_i,\F_2).
$$
\end{proof}

There are two measures how ``big'' a profinite set is.

\begin{defi}
Let $S$ be a profinite set. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The {\em size} of $S$ is $\kappa=|S|$.
\item The {\em weight} of $S$ is $\lambda=|\Cont(S,\F_2)|$.
\item $S$ is {\em light} if $\lambda\leq\om=|\N|$.
\end{itemize}
\end{defi}

\begin{rem}
If $\lambda$ is infinite, then $\lambda$ is the smallest
  cardinality of an index set $I$ such that $S=\lim_{i\in I}S_i$.
Thus, $S$ is light iff is is a countable limit of finite sets.
\end{rem}

\begin{example}[Examples of profinite sets]
(0) Finite sets.
  
(1) $S = \N\cup\{\infty\} = \lim_n\{0,1,\dots,n,\infty\}$ has $\kappa=\lambda=\om$. 

(2) The {\em Cantor set} $S = \{0,1\}^\N = \lim_n\{0,1\}^n$ has
  $\kappa=2^\om$ and $\lambda=\om$.

(3) The {\em Stone-\v{C}ech compactification} $S=\beta\N$ satisfies 
$$
  \Cont(\beta\N,\F_2) = \Cont(\N,\F_2) \cong \{\text{subset of }\N\},
$$
so it has $\kappa=2^{2^\om}$ and $\lambda=2^\om$. 
\end{example}

\begin{prop}
(a) We always have $\lambda\leq 2^\kappa$ and $\kappa\leq 2^\lambda$. \\
(b) If $\kappa=\om$ then $\lambda=\om$. 
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
(a) follows from
\begin{align*}
  \lambda &= |\Cont(S,\F_2)| \leq |\Map(S,\F_2)| = 2^\kappa, \cr
  \kappa &= |\Hom(A,\F_2)| \leq |\Map(A,\F_2)| = 2^\lambda.
\end{align*}
(b) Write $S=\{s_0,s_1,s_2,\dots\}$ and choose quotients
$S\twoheadrightarrow S_n$ which restrict to injections
$\{s_0,\dots,s_n\}\into S_n$. Then the induced map $S\to\lim_n S_n$ is
injective and surjective.
%and thus $\Cont(S,\F_2)=\colim_n\Cont(S_n,\F_2)$ is countable.   
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
The same proof shows: if $\kappa$ is infinite then $\lambda\leq\kappa$.
\end{rem}

\begin{prop}
The following categories are equivalent to the category of light
profinite sets:

1) $\text{\bf Pro}_{\N}\text{\bf Fin}$ \\
Objects: $\lim_{n\in\N}S_n$ for $S_n$ finite sets
\\
Morphisms: 
\begin{align*}
  \Hom(\lim_{n\in\N}S_n,\lim_{m\in\N}T_m)
  &:= \lim_m\colim_n\Map(S_n,T_m) \cr
  &= \colim_f\lim_m\Map(S_{f(m)},T_m)
\end{align*}
over strictly increasing maps $f:\N\to\N$.
  
2) {\em Metrizable} totally disconnected compact Hausdorff spaces

3) $(\text{{\em Countable} Boolean algebras})^{\rm op}$
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
The category of light profinite sets has all countable
limits. Sequential limits of surjections are surjective. 
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
For each light profinite set $S$ there exists a surjection
$\{0,1\}^\N\to S$. 
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Exercise (simple induction).
\end{proof}

The following two propositions are special to {\em light} profinite
sets. 

\begin{prop}
Let $S$ be a {\em light} profinite set. Then every open subset $U\subset S$
is a countable union of light profinite sets. 
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Write $S=\lim_{n\in\N}S_n$ with $S_n$ finite and the canonical maps
$\pi_n:S\to S_n$. Denote $Z:=S\setminus U$ and $Z_n:=\pi_n(Z)\subset S_n$.
Then $U=\bigcup_n\pi_n^{-1}(S_n\setminus Z_n)$, and thus $Z=\lim_nZ_n$. 
Each $\pi_n^{-1}(S_n\setminus Z_n)\subset S$ is {\em clopen} (closed
and open), and
$$
  U = \coprod_n\Bigl(\pi_{n+1}^{-1}(S_{n+1}\setminus Z_{n+1})\setminus
  \pi_n^{-1}(S_n\setminus Z_n)\Bigr).
$$
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
There exist open subsets $U\subset S$ of profinite sets $S$ with
sheaf cohomology $H^i(U;\Z)\neq 0$ for some $i>0$, so $U$ is not 
a countable union of profinite sets.
\end{rem}

\begin{prop}
Let $S$ be a nonempty {\em light} profinite set. Then $S$ is an
injective object in {\bf ProFin}, i.e., for each injection $Z\subset
X$ of profinite sets each morphism $Z\to S$ extends to $X$: 
$$
\xymatrix{
  X \ar@{-->}[rd] \\ 
  Z \ar@{^{(}->}[u] \ar[r] & S
}
$$
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
In the special case $S=\F_2$ the restriction map
$\Cont(X,\F_2)\to\Cont(Z,\F_2)$ is surjective because each clopen
subset of $Z$ extends to a clopen subset of $X$. 
In the general case, write $S=\lim_n S_n$. We may assume that each map
$S_{n+1}\to S_n$ is surjective. By induction over $n$, suppose we
already have extended the map $Z\to S_n$ to $X\to S_n$. By
decomposition into fibers over $S_n$, it suffices to consider the case
$S_n=\{*\}$. Then $S_{n+1}$ is finite and the extension follows
from the special case. 
\end{proof}

\subsection{Light condensed sets}
%%%

\begin{defi}
A {\em light condensed set} is a sheaf on the category of light
profinite sets with the Grothendieck topology generated by
\begin{enumerate}
\item finite disjoint unions;
\item {\em all} surjective maps.
\end{enumerate}
Equivalently, this is a functor 
$$
  X: \text{Pro}_\N\text{Fin}^{\rm op} \to \text{Sets},\qquad S\mapsto X(S)
$$
satisfying
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{-1}
\item $X(\varnothing)=*$;
\item $X(S_1\amalg S_2)\stackrel{\sim}\longrightarrow X(S_1)\times X(S_2)$;
\item Each surjection $f:T\twoheadrightarrow S$ induces an isomorphism
$$
  f^*:X(S) \stackrel{\cong}\longrightarrow {\rm eq}\Bigl(X(T)
  \overset{p_1^*}{\underset{p_2^*}{\rightrightarrows}} X(T\times_ST)\Bigr).
$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{defi}

\begin{example}[Key example]
Each topological space $A$ defines a light condensed set 
$$
  \ul{A}: S\mapsto\Cont(S,A).
$$
Here condition (2) is equivalent to the fact that surjections between
compact Hausdorff spaces are quotient maps. We have
\begin{itemize}
\item $\ul{A}(*) = A$ as a set; 
\item $\ul{A}(\N\cup\{\infty\}) = \{\text{convergent sequences in $A$
  (with chosen limit point)}\}$;
\item $\ul{A}(\text{Cantor set})$ carries an action of
  $\End(\text{Cantor set})$. 
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

For any light condensed set $X$, we view $X(\N\cup\{\infty\})$ as the
``convergent sequences in $X$''. 

\begin{remark}[Useless remark]
A light condensed set $X$ is completely determined by $X(\text{Cantor
  set})$ with its action of $\End(\text{Cantor set})$.
\end{remark}

\begin{prop}
The functor
$$
  \text{Top} \to \text{CondSet}^{\rm light},\qquad A\mapsto\ul{A}
$$
has a left adjoint $X\mapsto X(*)_{\rm top}$. Here $X(*)_{\rm top}$ is
the set $X(*)$ equipped with the quotient topology from
$\coprod_{\alpha\in X(\text{Cantor set})}\text{Cantor set} \to X(*)$.
\end{prop}

\begin{remark}
$X(*)_{\rm top}$ is a {\em metrizably compactly generated topological
  space}. For any such space $A$ we have an isomorphism
  $\ul{A}(*)_{\rm top}\stackrel{\sim}\to A$. 
\end{remark}

\begin{cor}
The functor
$$
  \{\text{metrizably compactly generated topological space}s\} \into
  \text{CondSet}^{\rm light}
$$
is full and faithful. 
\end{cor}

\begin{rem}[Historical precursors]
1) Johnstone's ``topological topos'', based on just $\N\cup\{\infty\}$
and the canonical topology. This is not finitary and shares the bad
algebraic properties of topoi. 

2) Escordo and Xu considered light profinite sets with only finite
disjoint unions as covers. 
\end{rem}

\subsection{Light condensed abelian groups}
%%%

Recall that for sheaves on any site, sheaves of abelian groups form a
{\em Grothendieck abelian category}: all limits and colimits exist,
and filtered colimits are exact. 
Thus, $\text{CondAb}^{\rm light}$ is a Grothendieck abelian category. 

\begin{example}
What are the cokernels of the inclusions
$$
  \Q_\disc\into\R \quad\text{and}\quad \R_\disc\to \R?
$$
In the first case we have $\ul{\R}/\ul{\Q_\disc}(*)=\R/\Q$ and 
$$
  (\ul{\R}/\ul{\Q_\disc})(S) = \Cont(S,\R)/\Cont(S,\Q_\disc),
$$
where $\Cont(S,\Q_\disc)$ consists of locally constant maps.
In the second case we have $\ul{\R}/\ul{\R_\disc}(*)=\R/\R=0$ and 
$$
  (\ul{\R}/\ul{\R_\disc})(S) = \Cont(S,\R)/\Cont(S,\R_\disc),
$$
where $\Cont(S,\R_\disc)$ again consists of locally constant maps.
The abelian group $(\ul{\R}/\ul{\R_\disc})(S)$ is e.g.~nontrivial for
$S$ the Cantor set.
\end{example}

\begin{thm}
$\text{CondAb}^{\rm light}$ is a Grothendieck abelian category with
  tensor products and the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Countable products are exact and satisfy Grothendieck's axiom
  (A86).
\item The free light condensed abelian group $\Z[\N\cup\{\infty\}]$ is
  {\em internally projective}. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

Here the functor 
$$
  \text{CondAb}^{\rm light} \to \text{CondSet}^{\rm light}
$$
has a left adjoint $X\mapsto \Z[X]$.
